# RentOptimizer
RentOptimizer is a tool designed to help tenants make informed decisions when renting a home in Iran. By considering the amount they can afford to pay monthly, expected annual inflation rate, and the expected growth rate of gold prices, RentOptimizer provides recommendations on the optimal ratio of deposit (Rahn) to monthly rent. This ensures that tenants can maximize their financial benefits while minimizing costs in a fluctuating economic environment.<br><br>
To optimize your rental contract, refer to the [Python notebook](https://github.com/BolandianBolandian/RentOptimizer/blob/main/RentOptimizer.ipynb) in this repository. It contains the necessary code and instructions to help you make informed decisions on your rent and deposit ratio.
